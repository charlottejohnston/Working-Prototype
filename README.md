# Working-Prototype

The major goal that our working prototype supports is that it allows a user to request a ride via a Google Form. 
The form prompts the user to consider exactly what they are looking for in a ride, including timing and destination.

To open the prototype, open the file index.html in a web browser. The buttons that are functional in this prototype are 
the ones that say "Request a Ride" and "Request Ride Here" which links to our ride request form.
